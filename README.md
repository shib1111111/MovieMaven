# streamlit_new
This is a Python code for a movie recommendation system that recommends similar movies based on a user's input of their favorite movie. The code uses IMDbPY library to search for the movie entered by the user and retrieves its details and ratings. It then saves the movie data and ratings to CSV files, loads the dataset, and creates a user-item matrix by pivoting the data. The user-item matrix is converted to a sparse matrix and trained using the nearest neighbors algorithm. Finally, the code recommends similar movies based on the trained model and displays them using Streamlit.
