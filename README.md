# movie details 
This app is a movie details search engine built using Python and Streamlit. It allows users to enter a movie title and retrieve information such as the movie's rating, year, plot, top 10 cast members, and top 5 recommendations. The app uses the IMDb module to search for and retrieve movie details, and it displays the results in a visually appealing format using Streamlit's built-in layout functions and custom CSS styling.
